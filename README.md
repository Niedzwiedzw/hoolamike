# 🏄 Hoolamike: Wabbajack Modlist Installer for Linux 

Hoolamike is here to ease the process of installing **Wabbajack modlists** on Linux without the hassle of virtual machines or Wine. This project ports the functionality on a **per-modlist basis**, enabling seamless integration with your favorite games. 🌟

## 🚀 Current Support Focus

- [**Tuxborn**](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Tuxborn): A Wabbajack Modlist for Skyrim SE designed with the Steam Deck in mind 🐉  
- [**Wasteland Reborn**](https://github.com/Camora0/Wasteland-Reborn): modlist that aims to create a fully featured, lore friendly rebuild of Fallout 4 from the ground up.  ☢️

## 💡 Goals

Wabbajack modlist installation logic is being slowly ported from C# to Rust, while keeping linux support constantly in mind.  🛠️
## ❌ Non-goals 
Replacing Wabbajack, modlist creation - this project focuses only on installation of modlists keeping them compatible with Wabbajack.
