## üí° Goals

Wabbajack modlist installation logic is being slowly ported from C# to Rust, while keeping linux support constantly in mind.  üõ†Ô∏è
## ‚ùå Non-goals 
Replacing Wabbajack, modlist creation - this project focuses only on installation of modlists keeping them compatible with Wabbajack.

## ‚≠ê Features

- üêß **Linux Native**: Say goodbye to VMs or Wine setup, enjoy quick and streamlined installation process.  
- ‚ö° **Optimized for Performance**: Parallelization of installation steps is one of the main focuses. As much as possible is performed in a multithreaded fashion to lower the wait time.
- üìö **Per-Modlist Focus**: Tailored support for specific modlists.  

## üèÑ How to Get Started with Hoolamike
1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/Niedzwiedzw/hoolamike/releases, unpack the archive and give appropriate permissions to hoolamike (`chmod u+x hoolamike`). You can place the binary wherever you want.
2. Configure Hoolamike:
    Run `hoolamike print-default-config > hoolamike.yaml` to generate a default configuration file. (or ask for examples on **[Discord Community](https://discord.gg/xYHjpKX3YP)**)
3. Edit `hoolamike.yaml` in a text editor. Add your Nexus API key, which you can obtain from https://next.nexusmods.com/settings/api-keys.
    Specify game directories, such as:
```
  games:
    Fallout4:
      root_directory: "/path/to/Fallout 4/"
```
4. Obtain the required modlist file: Download the <modlist-name>.wabbajack file for your desired modlist. You might need to check the Wabbajack community for the appropriate link. Place this file in the same directory as hoolamike.yaml.
5. Update the configuration: In `hoolamike.yaml`, set the path to the downloaded .wabbajack file under `installation.wabbajack_file_path`.
6. Install the modlist: Run `hoolamike install`. 

If you face any issues, consult the **[Discord Community](https://discord.gg/xYHjpKX3YP)** for further guidance or file a support ticket.

## üöß Compiling from source
1. Install the Rust toolchain: Visit https://rustup.rs/ to install Rust.
2. Clone the Hoolamike repository: Run git clone https://github.com/Niedzwiedzw/hoolamike to download the project files.
3. Switch to the nightly Rust compiler: Run rustup default nightly to set the nightly version as default. This step is required because Hoolamike uses features available only in the nightly version of Rust.
4. Install Hoolamike using Cargo: Navigate to the repository and execute `cargo install --path crates/hoolamike`.
5. Verify the installation: Once installed, the binary will typically be located in ~/.cargo/bin/. Ensure the binary is in your system's $PATH, or reference it directly by running ~/.cargo/bin/hoolamike. You should see a help message indicating successful installation.## üí¨ Join the Community
